# Quick Deployment Summary

You have everything you need! Here are the essential files for deployment:

## Essential Files:
- **Dockerfile** - Builds your blog into a container
- **docker-compose.yml** - Runs blog + nginx reverse proxy  
- **nginx.conf** - Routes traffic to your blog
- **deploy.sh** - Simple deployment script
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Full deployment guide

## Quick Start on Your Server:

1. **Upload your project** (or git clone)
2. **Edit nginx.conf** - replace `your-domain.com` with your domain
3. **Run deployment:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

That's it! Your blog will be running on port 80 (with nginx) or port 3000 (direct).

## If You Don't Want Nginx:
Just remove the nginx service from `docker-compose.yml` and use port 3000 directly.

## Common Commands:
```bash
# Deploy
./deploy.sh

# View logs  
docker-compose logs -f blog

# Stop
docker-compose down

# Update after changes
git pull && ./deploy.sh
```

Your blog is ready to deploy! ðŸš€
