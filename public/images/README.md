# Blog Images

This directory contains images for blog posts. 

To add images to your blog posts:

1. Place your image files in this directory
2. Reference them in your markdown posts using: `![Alt text](/images/your-image.jpg)`
3. Include the image path in your post's frontmatter: `image: "/images/your-image.jpg"`

## Image Guidelines

- Use web-optimized formats (JPEG, WebP, PNG)
- Keep file sizes reasonable for fast loading
- Use descriptive file names
- Consider image dimensions for consistent display

## Placeholder Images

For now, the blog posts reference placeholder images that don't exist yet. You can:

1. Add actual images with the referenced filenames
2. Update the markdown posts to reference different images
3. Remove image references from posts if not needed

The Next.js Image component will automatically optimize images for performance.
