# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! This blog is built with **Next.js** and supports markdown files for easy content creation.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write posts in markdown format
- **Search Functionality**: Find posts quickly
- **Tag System**: Organize posts with tags
- **Clean Design**: Minimalist black and white aesthetic
- **Image Support**: Display images seamlessly

## Getting Started

To create a new blog post, simply add a new markdown file to the `posts` directory with the following frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2025-05-30"
description: "A brief description of your post"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
image: "/images/your-image.jpg"
---

Your content here...
```

The blog will automatically pick up new posts and display them on the homepage.

## Image Support

You can include images in your posts using standard markdown syntax:

![Example Image](/images/ubuntu.webp)

Images are automatically optimized for performance.

Enjoy writing!
