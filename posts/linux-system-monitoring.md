# Mastering Linux System Monitoring with htop, iostat, and sar

System monitoring is crucial for maintaining healthy Linux servers and identifying performance bottlenecks before they impact your applications. This guide covers essential monitoring tools that every Linux administrator should master.

## Why System Monitoring Matters

Effective monitoring helps you:
- Identify resource bottlenecks early
- Plan capacity upgrades
- Troubleshoot performance issues
- Optimize system configuration
- Maintain service availability

## htop: Interactive Process Viewer

htop is an enhanced version of the traditional `top` command, providing a more user-friendly interface for monitoring system processes.

### Installation

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install htop -y

# CentOS/RHEL/Rocky Linux
sudo yum install htop -y

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S htop
```

### Basic Usage

Simply run:
```bash
htop
```

### Understanding the htop Interface

#### Header Section
- **CPU Usage**: Shows per-core CPU utilization with color coding
- **Memory**: RAM and swap usage with visual bars
- **Load Average**: 1, 5, and 15-minute load averages
- **Tasks**: Number of total, running, sleeping, stopped, and zombie processes
- **Uptime**: System uptime information

#### Color Coding
- **Blue**: Low-priority processes
- **Green**: Normal user processes
- **Red**: Kernel processes
- **Yellow**: IRQ time
- **Magenta**: Soft IRQ time
- **Cyan**: Steal time (virtualized environments)

### Key Commands in htop

```bash
# Navigation
↑/↓         # Navigate process list
Home/End    # Jump to top/bottom
PgUp/PgDn   # Page up/down

# Sorting
F6 or >     # Sort by different columns
P           # Sort by CPU usage
M           # Sort by memory usage
T           # Sort by TIME+

# Process Management
F9 or k     # Kill selected process
F7/F8       # Change process priority
F4 or \     # Filter processes
F5 or t     # Tree view toggle

# Display Options
F2          # Setup screen
H           # Hide/show user threads
K           # Hide/show kernel threads
```

### Customizing htop

Press F2 to access setup options:

1. **Colors**: Choose color schemes
2. **Display Options**: Show/hide various elements
3. **Columns**: Add/remove columns like PPID, USER, PRIORITY
4. **Meters**: Customize header layout

### htop Configuration File

htop saves configuration in `~/.config/htop/htoprc`:

```bash
# View current configuration
cat ~/.config/htop/htoprc

# Reset to defaults
rm ~/.config/htop/htoprc
```

## iostat: I/O Statistics

iostat provides detailed input/output statistics for devices and partitions, helping identify storage bottlenecks.

### Installation

iostat is part of the sysstat package:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install sysstat -y

# CentOS/RHEL/Rocky Linux
sudo yum install sysstat -y
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Basic I/O statistics
iostat

# Extended statistics every 2 seconds
iostat -x 2

# Monitor specific device
iostat -x sda 1

# Show statistics since boot
iostat -x 1 1
```

### Understanding iostat Output

#### Device Statistics
```
Device            r/s     w/s     rkB/s     wkB/s   rrqm/s   wrqm/s  %rrqm  %wrqm     r_await    w_await aqu-sz rareq-sz wareq-sz  svctm  %util
sda              1.25    2.30     45.23    123.45     0.12     0.45   8.76  16.38        2.34       4.56   0.01    36.18    53.67   1.23   0.45
```

Key metrics:
- **r/s, w/s**: Reads/writes per second
- **rkB/s, wkB/s**: Kilobytes read/written per second
- **%util**: Percentage of time device was busy
- **await**: Average time for I/O requests (milliseconds)
- **svctm**: Average service time

### Useful iostat Commands

```bash
# Show extended statistics for all devices
iostat -x

# Monitor every 5 seconds, 12 times
iostat -x 5 12

# Show statistics for specific devices
iostat -x sda sdb 2

# Include timestamps
iostat -xt 1

# Show CPU and device statistics
iostat -c -d 2
```

### Interpreting Performance Issues

#### High %util
- Indicates storage bottleneck
- Consider faster storage or load balancing

#### High await/svctm
- Slow response times
- Check for failing drives or overloaded storage

#### High r/s or w/s with low throughput
- Many small I/O operations
- Consider optimizing application I/O patterns

## sar: System Activity Reporter

sar collects and reports system activity information, providing historical data for performance analysis.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Current CPU usage
sar

# CPU usage every 2 seconds, 5 times
sar 2 5

# Memory usage
sar -r

# I/O statistics
sar -b

# Network statistics
sar -n DEV
```

### Common sar Options

#### CPU Monitoring
```bash
# Overall CPU usage
sar -u 1 10

# Per-CPU statistics
sar -P ALL 1 5

# CPU usage for specific CPU
sar -P 0 1 5
```

#### Memory Monitoring
```bash
# Memory utilization
sar -r 1 10

# Memory statistics including buffers/cache
sar -R 1 5

# Swap space utilization
sar -S 1 10
```

#### I/O Monitoring
```bash
# I/O transfer rates
sar -b 1 10

# Block device statistics
sar -d 1 10

# Specific device monitoring
sar -d -p 1 10
```

#### Network Monitoring
```bash
# Network interface statistics
sar -n DEV 1 10

# Network error statistics
sar -n EDEV 1 10

# TCP statistics
sar -n TCP 1 10

# UDP statistics
sar -n UDP 1 10
```

### Historical Data Analysis

sar stores historical data in `/var/log/sysstat/` (or `/var/log/sa/`):

```bash
# View yesterday's CPU data
sar -u -f /var/log/sysstat/saDD

# View specific time range
sar -r -s 10:00:00 -e 18:00:00

# Generate daily report
sar -A > daily_report.txt
```

### Setting Up Data Collection

Enable automatic data collection by editing `/etc/cron.d/sysstat`:

```bash
# Collect data every 10 minutes
*/10 * * * * root /usr/lib64/sa/sa1 1 1

# Generate daily reports
53 23 * * * root /usr/lib64/sa/sa2 -A
```

## Advanced Monitoring Techniques

### Combining Tools for Comprehensive Analysis

#### Real-time Performance Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# performance_monitor.sh

echo "=== System Performance Monitor ==="
echo "Date: $(date)"
echo

echo "=== CPU Usage ==="
sar -u 1 1 | tail -n 1

echo "=== Memory Usage ==="
sar -r 1 1 | tail -n 1

echo "=== I/O Statistics ==="
iostat -x 1 1 | grep -A 20 "Device"

echo "=== Top Processes ==="
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -6

echo "=== Load Average ==="
uptime
```

#### Performance Alert Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# alert_monitor.sh

CPU_THRESHOLD=80
MEM_THRESHOLD=85
DISK_THRESHOLD=90

# Check CPU usage
CPU_USAGE=$(sar -u 1 1 | tail -1 | awk '{print 100-$8}')
if (( $(echo "$CPU_USAGE > $CPU_THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "ALERT: High CPU usage: $CPU_USAGE%"
fi

# Check memory usage
MEM_USAGE=$(free | grep Mem | awk '{printf "%.1f", $3/$2 * 100.0}')
if (( $(echo "$MEM_USAGE > $MEM_THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "ALERT: High memory usage: $MEM_USAGE%"
fi

# Check disk usage
df -h | awk 'NR>1 {gsub(/%/,"",$5); if($5 > '$DISK_THRESHOLD') print "ALERT: High disk usage on " $6 ": " $5"%"}'
```

### Creating Custom Monitoring Dashboards

#### Simple Web Dashboard with HTML
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>System Monitor</title>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>System Performance Dashboard</h1>
    <pre id="stats">
        <!-- Auto-refreshed system stats -->
    </pre>
    <script>
        // Add JavaScript for real-time updates
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Monitoring Schedule

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### High CPU Usage
```bash
# Identify CPU-intensive processes
htop (sort by CPU)
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10

# Check for runaway processes
sar -u 1 10
```

### Memory Issues
```bash
# Check memory usage patterns
sar -r 1 10
free -h

# Identify memory-hungry processes
htop (sort by memory)
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10
```

### I/O Bottlenecks
```bash
# Monitor I/O performance
iostat -x 1 10
iotop (if available)

# Check specific device performance
iostat -x sda 1 10
```
